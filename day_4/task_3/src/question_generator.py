        Guidelines for question generation:
        1. Questions should be specific and focused on the topic
        2. Include questions about historical discoveries and significance
        3. Ask about current research and recent findings
        4. Include questions about the scientific importance
        5. Questions should be educational and informative
        6. Avoid overly basic or overly complex questions
        7. Focus on what makes this topic interesting and important in astronomy
        
        Generate exactly 5-6 questions that follow this format:
        1. [Question about basic features/definition]
        2. [Question about historical discovery/significance]
        3. [Question about current research/recent findings]
        4. [Question about scientific importance/impact]
        5. [Question about interesting facts or phenomena]
